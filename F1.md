**F1 – Gateway → Runtime Flow** in a **flow-centric layout**, not row-centric.

---

## 🧭 **Concept: Flow-based Functional Blueprint**

The slide becomes a **left-to-right pipeline** (data and control movement),
with **feedback arcs looping backward** (governance, telemetry).
Think of it as a **river with tributaries and a feedback loop** — not layers.

---

### 🟩 **Overall Canvas Layout**

* **Orientation:** Landscape 16:9
* **Flow:** Left → Right (primary execution), Right → Left (feedback)
* **Zones:**

  1. **Entry (User / Gateway Trigger)** – left edge
  2. **Control & Policy Corridor** – just after entry
  3. **Agentic Core** – center (the engine room)
  4. **Data / Tools Tributary** – bottom branch feeding up into the core
  5. **Telemetry & Governance Loop** – arcs back from right → left

---

## 🔹 **Section 1 – Entry: User to Gateway**

**Left vertical cluster (stacked icons):**

* **AskRegn-AI UI** → short note: *“User query, file, or task trigger”*
* ↓ arrow labeled *“SSO + Context Tags (OKTA / AD)”*
* **Gateway Ingress Node** box: *“API Router (Kong / Azure APIM)”*

  * annotation: *“Normalizes, validates, routes to correct LLM domain.”*

> This zone covers **VS1 Deliverables 1–2**: Authenticated entry, routing.

---

## 🔹 **Section 2 – Control & Policy Corridor**

**Immediately right of ingress; two small boxes chained horizontally:**

1. **Policy Enforcement (OPA Adapter)**
   *“Applies PII mask, region restrictions, model risk policies.”*
2. **Cost / Token Meter Service**
   *“Real-time usage metering, quota check, FinOps log.”*

A thin upward arrow from here to top-right corner labeled
→ *“Splunk Audit / ServiceNow Ticket (21 CFR 11)”*

> These nodes together show **Gateway logic** before execution.

## 🔹 **Section 3 – Agentic Core (Heart of Slide)**

Large central ellipse or rectangle titled
**“Agentic Runtime Orchestrator (VS2)”**

Inside it, show **five inner nodes** arranged clockwise:

1. **Planner Agent** (top-left)
   → “Breaks task into steps; selects tools.”
   → arrow to Executor.

2. **Executor Agent** (top-right)
   → “Runs steps, enforces policy hooks.”
   → arrow down to Tools.

3. **Tool Adapter Hub (MCP Server)** (bottom-right)
   → “Invokes PubMed, NCI, Veeva, Confluence APIs.”
   → arrow left to Memory.

4. **Memory / Context Store** (bottom-left)
   → “Retrieves previous context / embeddings (Redis + Milvus).”
   → arrow up to Evaluator.

5. **Evaluator / Reflection Agent** (center)
   → “Validates outputs, triggers correction loop if score < threshold.”
   → arrow back to Planner (closing inner loop).

Label the circle of arrows **“Plan → Act → Reflect loop.”**

> This is the functional behavior core — satisfies **VS2 Deliverables 1-3**.

---

## 🔹 **Section 4 – Data & Tools Tributary (bottom branch)**

At the bottom of the slide, draw a horizontal “tool row” feeding upward into the MCP Hub:

* PubMed, NCI, Veeva, Confluence, Dremio, Milvus icons.
* Arrows going upward labeled *“API calls / vector queries.”*
* Caption: *“External + internal data services accessed via secure MCP connectors.”*

> Represents **data retrieval & tool orchestration** deliverables.

---

## 🔹 **Section 5 – Output & Feedback**

At the far right of the Agentic Core:

* **Output Synthesizer box:** *“Composed response / report to user.”*
* Arrow back to **AskRegn-AI UI** (top left) labeled *“Final result to user.”*
* Parallel upward arrow to **AIOps / Telemetry collector:**
  *“Latency, cost, error, model metrics → Grafana / FinOps.”*
* From telemetry collector, an **orange feedback loop** bending back left across the top:
  *“Governance & Policy Updates (OPA / Git Registry) → Gateway.”*

> This arc closes **the compliance feedback loop** between **VS2** and **VS1**.

## 🔸 **Numbered Flow Steps (put along arrows)**

1️⃣ User query → Gateway Ingress
2️⃣ Auth + Policy Enforcement
3️⃣ Planner creates action plan
4️⃣ Executor invokes MCP tools
5️⃣ Data & memory enrich execution
6️⃣ Evaluator validates result
7️⃣ Response returned to user
8️⃣ Telemetry + audit sent to AIOps / Governance
9️⃣ Governance updates policy → Gateway

## 🔸 **Footer Line**

> *Functional view of VS1 (AI Gateway) and VS2 (Agentic Runtime): shows how authenticated user requests flow through policy-aware gateway, agentic planning/execution, data retrieval, and governance feedback per RFP §5.2 & §5.4.*

---

### 🧠 **Visual Tips**

* Use **curved arrows** for the feedback loop to emphasize dynamism.
* Keep the Agentic Core big and central — it’s the “engine.”
* Color nodes by role:

  * Gateway/control = teal,
  * Agents = blue,
  * Tools/data = grey,
  * Governance = orange.
* Include a tiny legend bottom-right: “Components reused from Component Architecture: API Router, OPA Adapter, Meter Service, Planner Agent, Executor, MCP Server, Memory, Evaluator, Telemetry, Governance Hub.”
