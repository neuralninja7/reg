**final, corrected and conceptually aligned blueprint** for **VS-2: Agentic Runtime & Orchestration Platform**, with the tenets rewritten to sound like *principles* rather than *components* while still preserving the technical intent and traceability to your logical architecture.

# 🧩 **Final Blueprint — VS-2: Agentic Runtime & Orchestration Platform**

---

## 🔹 **Quadrant 1 – Our Understanding of the Value Stream**

### 🧠 Client Intent

* Establish an **enterprise-grade runtime framework**—not just a set of autonomous agents.
  It must accommodate **three behavioral patterns**:

  * **Autonomous Planning Agents** – goal-oriented, self-reasoning, self-delegating.
  * **Static Workflow Agents** – deterministic, rule-based, zero autonomy.
  * **Hybrid Agents** – switch between autonomous and fixed modes based on policy.
* Support a **multi-mode execution layer** where each task can run as either

  * a **pre-defined workflow** (RPA/BPM/scripted pipeline) or
  * a **dynamic agentic plan** generated on demand.
* Provide **tooling independence**: every tool may be a

  * shell or Python script,
  * **LLM-based tool**,
  * **RPA bot**, or
  * external API service — all addressable through a unified *Tool Interface Protocol*.
* Embed **governance and HITL (supervision)** at runtime: approval, audit, explainability.

> **In essence →** VS-2 delivers a *continuum* from static automation to governed autonomy, under a single secure control plane.

## 🔹 **Quadrant 2 – Key Solution Tenets (visual diagram)**

| **Tenet / Principle**                   | **Essence (One-Line Summary)**                                                     | **Underlying Logical Components Mapped**  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Design Framework**              | Enables creation and governance of autonomous, hybrid, and static agent patterns.  | Agent Lifecycle Manager + Policy Layer    |
| **Workflow Composition**                | Unifies pre-defined deterministic workflows with adaptive agentic flows.           | Orchestration Engine (deterministic mode) |
| **Orchestration & Coordination**        | Handles distributed task planning, delegation, and concurrent agent execution.     | Orchestration Engine + Message Bus        |
| **Tool Interoperability via MCP**       | Standardizes access to scripts, RPA bots, LLM tools, or APIs through MCP protocol. | MCP Server/Client Hub + Tool Connectors   |
| **Contextual Memory Management**        | Maintains task state and reasoning context for explainable, traceable execution.   | Redis + Milvus                            |
| **Policy-Aware Execution & Evaluation** | Applies governance rules and evaluation agents for risk, ethics, and compliance.   | Evaluator Agent + Compliance Hooks        |

**Edge Labels (on diagram):**

* **Inbound →** API Requests from Gateway (VS-1)
* **Outbound →** Telemetry → AIOps (VS-5)  |  Model Binding → VS-4  |  Data Context ↔ VS-6
* **Feedback ←** Governance Policies from VS-7

## 🔹 **Quadrant 3 – Build vs Buy Strategy**

| **Capability Area**                 | **Strategy**                       | **Rationale**                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Agent Design Framework              | 🟦 **Build (Custom)**              | PromProm-specific agent archetypes and design patterns require custom logic.         |
| Workflow Composition                | 🟨 **Extend (Buy + Customize)**    | Integrate existing low-code RPA/BPM platform (Power Automate / UiPath) with runtime. |
| Orchestration & Coordination        | 🟦 **Build (Core IP)**             | Foundation for dynamic planning and multi-agent coordination.                        |
| Tool Interoperability via MCP       | 🟨 **Buy + Extend**                | Adopt open MCP spec; extend with PromProm tool adapters.                             |
| Contextual Memory Management        | 🟩 **Buy (Azure Redis + Milvus)**  | Vendor-managed scale and performance.                                                |
| Policy-Aware Execution & Evaluation | 🟨 **Buy + Configure (OPA, OKTA)** | Reuse enterprise policy stack and IAM controls.                                      |

| **P2 – Agent Design Framework**          | Implement autonomous / static / hybrid agent templates and SDK.                   | Agent archetype library ready.      |
| **P3 – Workflow Composition Enablement** | Connect RPA/BPM tool; enable YAML-based static workflows alongside dynamic plans. | Unified static + dynamic execution. |
| **P4 – Tool Interoperability Layer**     | Standardize tool API; onboard first three tool types (script, LLM, RPA).          | Tool registry operational.          |
| **P5 – Governance & Scale-Up**           | Integrate evaluation agents + policy feedback; conduct load and scale tests.      | Production-ready VS-2 runtime.      |

### ✅ **Key Takeaway**

> **VS-2** delivers a **governed agentic framework**, not just autonomy.
> It allows **static workflows, hybrid flows, and autonomous agents** to coexist—each invoking any tool (script, RPA, LLM, API) through a common protocol, all under central policy and observability.

This version now:

* keeps **Quadrant 2** aligned with architectural **principles**, not components;
* explicitly models PromProm’s **three-mode execution (autonomous / static / hybrid)**;
* integrates full **tool-agnostic control** and **governance feedback**;
* maintains traceability to your **logical architecture** for reviewers.
