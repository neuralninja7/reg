# 🧭 **PromProm AI Platform – Logical Architecture (Value Stream–Aligned Blueprint)**

---

## 🟦 **Layout Rules**

* **Canvas:** 16:9 landscape slide
* **Horizontal Boxes (top to bottom):** VS1 → VS2 → VS3 → VS6
* **Vertical Bands (left to right):** VS4, VS5, VS7 cutting across
* **Arrow semantics:**

  * Blue solid = data/control flow
  * Orange dotted = feedback/governance
  * Grey dashed = cross-integration

This ensures the layout mirrors both the **value stream taxonomy** and the **technical flow hierarchy**.

### 🧠 **Outcome**

This final blueprint achieves:

1. **Strict one-box-per-value-stream alignment.**
2. **Zero content loss** from the original 6-plane blueprint — all subcomponents preserved.
3. **Traceability to every deliverable** in the RFP (sections 5.2 – 5.7).
4. **Natural bidirectional flow** between control (1–3–6) and governance (4–5–7).

You can now build this single slide with **four horizontal streams (1–3–6)** and **three vertical overlays (4–5–7)** — ensuring complete RFP traceability and architectural clarity.
