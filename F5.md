*Covers VS-7 (Governance & Responsible AI) + links into VS-1 (Gateway), VS-4 (Model Lifecycle), and VS-5 (AIOps Telemetry).*

**Purpose →** Show how PromProm’s AI ecosystem enforces **trust, compliance, transparency, and continuous policy feedback**, ensuring every agent, model, and dataset is governed ethically and auditable end-to-end.

## 🟦 Canvas Specification

* **Orientation:** Landscape 16 × 9
* **Flow:** Clockwise circular loop (policy → execution → telemetry → audit → policy update)
* **Visual form:** Concentric loop with inner “control hub” and outer feedback arcs
* **Color cues:**

  * Blue = control and execution events
  * Orange = governance feedback
  * Green = automation services
  * Grey = audit & storage systems

---

## 🔹 Functional Zones (Clockwise Narrative)

### **1️⃣ Policy Definition & Registry (Top-Left Quadrant)**

* **Policy Registry Service** (OPA + Git-backed Repo)
  *Stores enterprise AI policies, fairness thresholds, risk weights, and access controls.*
* **Compliance Template Library** (JSON/YAML artifacts)
  *Defines reusable guardrail templates for models, agents, and data connectors.*
  Arrow → **Enforcement Gateway.**

> **Deliverables:** VS-7 D1 (Policy Registry), VS-1 link (Gateway integration).

---

### **2️⃣ Policy Enforcement at Runtime (Top-Right Quadrant)**

* **Gateway Policy Adapter** (OPA runtime + FastAPI hook)
  *Injects masking, redaction, and PII rules before execution.*
* **Agentic Policy Middleware** (LangGraph Policy Node)
  *Evaluates ethical & performance limits during task execution.*
* **Model Risk Guard** (Deployment Hook)
  *Checks model version risk class before routing inference.*
  Arrows downward into **Telemetry & Logging Hub.**

> **Deliverables:** VS-7 D2 (Runtime Enforcement), RFP §5.2.3 Zero-Trust.

---

### **3️⃣ Telemetry & Logging Hub (Bottom-Right Segment)**

* **Audit Event Stream** (Prometheus → Kafka → Splunk)
  *Captures real-time runtime metrics, cost, latency, and decisions.*
* **Incident Bridge** (ServiceNow API)
  *Triggers alerts when thresholds violated.*
* **Evidence Store** (Splunk Immutable Index)
  *Maintains signed logs for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance.*
  Arrow → **Audit & Ethics Analyzer.**

> **Deliverables:** VS-5 link (AIOps Integration), VS-7 D3 (Audit Record Generation).

---

### **4️⃣ Audit & Ethics Analyzer (Bottom-Center Segment)**

* **Bias & Fairness Evaluator** (Python scorer + Explainability Toolkit)
  *Examines model outcomes for bias, data leakage, and unfair representation.*
* **Risk Aggregator Dashboard** (Grafana / PowerBI)
  *Aggregates risk scores by project, model, and team.*
* **Audit Report Generator** (ServiceNow Workflow + PDF export)
  *Produces auto-generated audit evidence packets.*
  Arrow upward → **Policy Review Board Workflow.**

> **Deliverables:** VS-7 D4 (Ethical Risk Assessment Engine), RFP §5.2.7 Responsible AI.

---

### **5️⃣ Policy Review & Update Workflow (Top-Center Segment)**

* **Governance Committee Portal** (SharePoint / Workflow App)
  *Human in the loop approves or rejects policy changes.*
* **Automated Policy Push Service** (FastAPI + Webhook)
  *Pushes updated policies → Gateway, Agentic Runtime, Model Registry.*
  Curved orange arrows return left to **Policy Registry** (closing loop).

> **Deliverables:** VS-7 D5 (Policy Feedback Mechanism), VS-1 link (Gateway update).

---

## 🔄 **Numbered Flow Steps (for arrows)**

1️⃣ Governance Board defines policy → stored in Registry.
2️⃣ Gateway & Agent Runtime enforce rules during execution.
3️⃣ Telemetry and logs collected continuously.
4️⃣ Bias and Risk Analyzers review outcomes + generate audit reports.
5️⃣ Governance Committee reviews findings and approves updates.
6️⃣ Policy Push Service propagates new rules → Gateway + Runtime + Registry.

## 🧠 Footer Text

> *Functional view covering VS-7 (Governance & Responsible AI): demonstrates closed-loop governance where policies are defined, enforced, monitored, and updated continuously across Gateway, Runtime, and Model Lifecycle components per RFP §5.2.7 and §5.4.6.*

---

### 🎨 Design Tips

* Use a **circular loop** to show continuous governance; center node labelled **“Governance Control Hub.”**
* Each quadrant = one lifecycle phase (Define → Enforce → Monitor → Audit → Update).
* Orange curved arrows for feedback loops.
* Include bottom-right legend: *Components Reused → OPA Repo, Gateway Policy Adapter, Splunk, ServiceNow, Ethics Analyzer, Governance Portal.*

### ✅ **Outcome**

When built, this slide will:

* Complete the **end-to-end functional architecture**, showing **governance as the central nervous system** connecting all planes.
* Explicitly deliver **all VS-7 outputs** and RFP compliance asks for audit, ethics, and policy feedback.
* Tie back every enforcement or logging element to concrete components from your Component Architecture.
