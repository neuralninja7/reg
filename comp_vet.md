Here’s a clear, defensible “why this tech” narrative that ties every component choice back to **PromProm’s existing stack** and to **explicit RFP asks**. I’m also flagging viable alternatives and when a different choice might be better.

# How this component architecture was derived

### Method (in one line)

1. **Anchor to what you already have**, 2) **map to the value-streams & non-functionals you require**, 3) **prefer fit-over-fashion** (reuse > buy > build), 4) **prove governability**.

Concretely, I cross-referenced PromProm’s stated **current stack** (NextJS MFE, FastAPI microservices, OKTA/AD, internal multi-LLM layer; Dremio + Milvus) with the **seven value streams** and their technical & compliance requirements (gateway scale, MCP, agentic runtime, RAG builder, observability, Splunk/ServiceNow, zero-trust, cost metering).

## Alignment with PromProm’s existing architecture (why these choices fit)

| Layer                        | Selected direction                                                                           | Why it aligns with what you have                                                            | RFP anchor |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Experience (AskRegn-AI)**  | Keep **NextJS MFE** for UX, admin, and builder UIs                                           | It’s your standard; reduces re-skill & integrates with current RAG apps                     |            |
| **Gateway & Control**        | **Central AI Gateway** with token/cost metering, policy & audit; integrate **SSO (OKTA/AD)** | Matches your zero-trust & multi-provider LLM access; adds routing, quotas, failover, Splunk |            |
| **Agentic Runtime**          | Orchestrator + MCP hub + memory + message bus                                                | RFP mandates **MCP** and multi-agent orchestration; keeps your internal LLM layer useful    |            |
| **Model/Prompt Engineering** | Catalog + eval + prompt studio; all calls **via Gateway**                                    | Centralizes reuse and policy; avoids shadow AI                                              |            |
| **Data/AIOps**               | **Dremio** for structured, **Milvus** for vectors; **Splunk** for logs; CI/CD, DR            | These are your declared standards; architecture formalizes them as first-class              |            |
| **Governance**               | Policy registry (OPA), audit, compliance reports; **ServiceNow** ITSM hooks                  | RFP calls out zero-trust, immutable audit, SIEM; ITSM integration in enterprise flows       |            |

## Deep rationale — component by component

> The theme: **reuse PromProm’s platform primitives and extend** to satisfy scale, security, and agentic/MCP asks.

### 1) AI Gateway (VS-1)

* **Choice:** API gateway + controller layer (e.g., Kong/Envoy + FastAPI controller) with **usage metering, cost center tags, rate/quotas, failover, caching**, **OKTA/AD**, **audit to Splunk**.
* **Why:** RFP requires multi-protocol (REST, WebSocket, GraphQL, **MCP**), request/response normalization, **token counting & cost calc**, and **10k+ concurrent** with ~50ms overhead; also zero-trust & SIEM integration. Your FastAPI/Microservices + OKTA/AD base fits perfectly.   
* **Alternatives:** Apigee/Azure APIM (faster to buy) vs. OSS (Kong/Envoy) + custom metering. If strict **50ms budget** is hard with external SaaS, lean OSS + edge-caching.
* **Risks/Mitigations:** Provider outages → **automatic model failover**; use circuit breakers & health probes. 

### 2) Agentic Runtime (VS-2)

* **Choice:** Containerized **planner/executor**, **message bus** (Kafka/NATS), **memory** (Redis + Milvus), **MCP server/client** for tool discovery, **service mesh** for secure S2S.
* **Why:** RFP asks for multi-agent orchestration, MCP server & client, dynamic tool registration, guaranteed delivery, scaling, and HITL controls.  
* **Alternatives:** LangGraph/Temporal for durable workflows; consider Ray if heavy parallel tool use.
* **Risks/Mitigations:** Agent sprawl → **registry + versioning**; unsafe actions → **policy hooks via Gateway** + HITL checkpoints. 

### 3) Self-Service RAG Builder (VS-3)

* **Choice:** Data ingestion connectors (SharePoint, Veeva, Confluence, DBs), **chunking strategies**, lineage, **vector store** abstraction with **Milvus** default, cost telemetry, dual-mode UI in NextJS.
* **Why:** Exactly mirrors RFP: source breadth, sophisticated chunking, lineage, multi-embedding options, unified model interface, cost tracking, and layered architecture. It reuses Dremio/Milvus + AskRegn-AI UX.   
* **Alternatives:** Managed RAG builders (Azure AI Studio, Bedrock Knowledge Bases) if time-to-value > deep control; keep **Milvus** via adapter.
* **Risks/Mitigations:** Irregular docs → **multi-strategy chunkers** + evaluation harness.

### 4) Model Mgmt & Engineering (VS-4)

* **Choice:** **Catalog + discovery**, reuse-first recommendations, unified deployment (K8s/SageMaker/Bedrock), **eval bench**, **prompt studio**; **all via Gateway**.
* **Why:** The stream’s goal is to defragment AI, route everything through Gateway, and enforce governance while enabling reuse of internal/vended assets (incl. vendor agents with MCP/MCP-like protocols). 
* **Alternatives:** Open catalog (OpenLLMHub-style) + MLflow vs. commercial MRM; pick based on compliance reporting needs.
* **Risks/Mitigations:** Shadow AI → **mandatory registration + access via Gateway**.

### 5) AIOps / MLOps / Data Fabric (VS-5/6)

* **Choice:** **Dremio** for structured access, **Milvus** standard vectors, CI/CD (GitOps), **observability to Splunk**, SLO/error budgets, DR; cost lake for **chargeback**.
* **Why:** These are your stated data standards; RFP demands unified telemetry, cost attribution, and enterprise logging.  
* **Alternatives:** If cross-cloud, add OpenTelemetry exporters and Grafana for live SLI dashboards (Splunk remains system of record).
* **Risks/Mitigations:** Cost surprises → per-request token metering in Gateway + monthly BU reports.

### 6) Governance & Responsible AI (VS-7)

* **Choice:** **OPA-backed policy registry**, immutable audit, **PII detection**, encryption, MFA/SSO, and **ServiceNow** workflows for change/incident.
* **Why:** RFP: Zero-trust, OAuth/OIDC, RBAC, immutable logs, SIEM (Splunk), and ITSM integration across the platform. 

---

## Why specific technologies (selection basis)

* **NextJS MFE**: already adopted; minimizes switching cost; ideal for the RAG builder’s dual-mode UX and admin consoles. 
* **FastAPI**: your microservice standard; low-latency controllers for gateway normalization, metering, and policy sidecars. 
* **OKTA/AD + SSO (OAuth/OIDC/SAML)**: mandated by RFP for zero-trust and RBAC; aligns with current auth stack.  
* **Dremio** (structured) + **Milvus** (semantic): your corporate data standards; directly required in builder & agentic scenarios.  
* **MCP (server & client)**: explicitly required for agent-to-tool interop and agent-to-agent; underpins ecosystem extensibility. 
* **Splunk** SIEM + **ServiceNow** ITSM: called out for centralized logging/audit and enterprise workflow integration. 
* **Multi-LLM via existing internal layer**: you already expose 30+ models; the gateway formalizes routing/cost/quotas/failover. 

---

## Build vs Buy stance (per stream)

* **Gateway**: **Hybrid**. Buy gateway core (Kong/Envoy/Apigee) + **build** PromProm-specific transformers (prompt/response schemas), **token/cost** pipeline, and policy adapters to Splunk/ServiceNow. Justified by the RFP’s tight latency and deep metering/PII requirements. 
* **Agentic Runtime**: **Build on open frameworks** (LangGraph/Temporal) to meet **MCP** and enterprise message guarantees; vendor “agent studios” rarely meet your MCP + governance depth.  
* **RAG Builder**: **Hybrid**. Reuse Dremio/Milvus; build ingestion/chunking/lineage + dual-mode UI to match RFP; optional buy of connectors where it saves time. 
* **Model Eng.**: **Hybrid**. Catalog/eval can be bought; prompt studio likely **build** to match your AskRegn patterns and policy hooks.

## External scientific data rationale

RFP expects **PubMed/NCI/genomics** integration; the agentic/MCP design lets you add these as tools/services behind policy, keeping data egress auditable and cached. 

---

## Where this could deviate (and how we’d validate)

* **Latency budgets** at the gateway (50ms overhead target): we’ll benchmark SaaS vs OSS gateway paths and keep FastAPI controllers colocated with the gateway data plane. 
* **Cost governance**: enforce per-model quotas & BU tags from day-1 (RFP requirement), with monthly variance reports. 
* **Security & audit**: verify immutability and retention to your regulated timelines via Splunk settings and Gateway audit exporters. 

---

## Bottom line

* The proposed components **reuse your declared stack** (NextJS, FastAPI, OKTA/AD, multi-LLM, Dremio, Milvus) and **add exactly what the RFP demands** (central AI gateway with cost & policy, MCP-native agentic runtime, self-service RAG builder, unified observability & governance).
* Each pick is justified by an RFP requirement and anchored in your current choices — **minimizing disruption** while **maximizing governable scale**.
