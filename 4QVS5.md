# VS-5 – AIOps, MLOps & Operations Fabric

---

## 🔹 Quadrant 1 – Our Understanding of the Value Stream

**What PromProm wants from VS-5**

* A **central operations plane** that receives telemetry, logs, traces, and model events from **all other value streams** (VS-2 agentic runtime, VS-3 RAG builder, VS-4 model registry, VS-6 data fabric).
* **AIOps-style automation** — not just dashboards. Incidents raised from runtime/model/drift events must be able to **auto-remediate** or trigger standardized runbooks.
* **Unified CI/CD / MLOps** pipelines to deploy:

  * agents (VS-2),
  * RAG apps/prompts (VS-3/VS-4),
  * models/endpoints (VS-4).
    i.e. *one release discipline* for all AI assets.
* **FinOps & usage governance** — token/call/GPU/endpoint cost visibility, with the ability to feed limits back to the Gateway (VS-1).
* **Resilience & DR** for AI workloads: health checks, multi-AZ/region failover, periodic chaos/fault tests.
* **Compliance-aligned logging** so VS-7 can generate audit trails without re-instrumenting every workload.

> In short: **VS-5 is the “nervous system”** — it watches everything, deploys everything, and can fix (or at least alert on) everything.

## 🔹 Quadrant 2 – Key Solution Tenets (principle wording, not components)

| Tenet / Principle                | Essence                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Observability-by-Design**   | Every agent, RAG flow, model deploy, and data job emits logs/metrics/traces in a standard schema.       |
| **2. Ops-as-Automation (AIOps)** | Events → enrichment → rule/ML-based correlation → runbook / SSM automation → incident.                  |
| **3. Unified CI/CD & MLOps**     | One pipeline family to build, test, approve, and deploy agents, models, RAG apps, and tools.            |
| **4. Cost & Usage Governance**   | FinOps insights (token, endpoint, GPU, storage) pushed back to Gateway/Platform to throttle/chargeback. |
| **5. Resilience & DR-as-Code**   | DR, backups, chaos/fault injection, and failover defined as code and scheduled.                         |
| **6. Ops–Governance Coupling**   | Ops events (incidents/drift) are surfaced to VS-7 for policy update, audit, and RCA.                    |

**Side labels (to match your logical view):**

* **Inbound →** Telemetry & pipeline events from VS-2, VS-3, VS-4, VS-6
* **Outbound →** Cost / SLO / health signals to VS-1 (Gateway)
* **Feedback ←** Compliance / retention policies from VS-7

## 🔹 Quadrant 3 – Build vs Buy Strategy (AWS-first, dense, 1 row per component)

| **Component**                          | **Options (Top COTS / Managed)**                                                             | **Potential selection & rationale**                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Telemetry & Observability Fabric**   | **Amazon CloudWatch**, **AWS X-Ray**, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT), Datadog           | **CloudWatch + X-Ray + ADOT** — AWS-native, auto-evolving, no agent upgrades; Datadog optional for richer UX. |
| **Log / Trace Analytics**              | **Amazon OpenSearch Service**, CloudWatch Logs Insights, Datadog Logs                        | **OpenSearch Service** — managed, scalable, no software patching; reuse for search-first ops analytics.       |
| **AIOps / Auto-Remediation**           | **AWS Systems Manager Automation**, **AWS Incident Manager**, PagerDuty                      | **SSM Automation + Incident Manager** — serverless runbooks, ticketing, and on-call; upgrades handled by AWS. |
| **FinOps & Usage Metering**            | **AWS Cost Explorer / CUR**, **AWS Budgets**, CloudWatch metrics, 3rd-party CloudHealth      | **Cost Explorer + CUR + Budgets** — native, future-agile; can push budget/usage signals back to VS-1.         |
| **CI/CD for Agents, Models, RAG**      | **AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy**, **SageMaker Pipelines**                       | **CodePipeline + SageMaker Pipelines** — infra as code + model as code; both AWS-managed and auto-updated.    |
| **Model Monitoring & Drift Detection** | **SageMaker Model Monitor**, **SageMaker Clarify**, Open-source eval jobs on EKS             | **SageMaker Model Monitor** — managed drift/bias metrics; no platform upgrade needed.                         |
| **DR & Resilience Services**           | **AWS Backup**, **AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)**, AWS FIS (Fault Injection Simulator) | **AWS Backup + Elastic DR + FIS** — cloud-native, automated DR tests, no manual patch/upgrade.                |
| **Config & Compliance Tracking**       | **AWS Config**, **AWS Security Hub**, **AWS Audit Manager**                                  | **AWS Config + Audit Manager** — captures resource/config drift; feeds VS-7 for policy decisions.             |
| **Ops Runbook / Service Lineage View** | AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter, Service Catalog AppRegistry                                   | **SSM OpsCenter + AppRegistry** — light custom views, AWS-managed, minimal upkeep.                            |

**Applied rules:**

* Primary hyperscaler is **AWS** → prefer AWS-managed, auto-updating services.
* Customer is **buy-inclined** → we build only where RFP asks for cross-AI runbooks or special lineage views.
* All chosen COTS are **future-agile** (new features arrive without PromProm upgrading software).

## 🔹 Quadrant 4 – Implementation Approach

| **Phase**                            | **Activities**                                                                                                   | **Deliverable**                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **P1 – Observability Baseline**      | Instrument VS-2/VS-3/VS-4 with ADOT; centralize logs in CloudWatch/OpenSearch; define standard telemetry schema. | Unified ops telemetry plane live.                |
| **P2 – CI/CD & MLOps Enablement**    | Stand up CodePipeline and SageMaker Pipelines; create pipeline templates for agents, models, and RAG apps.       | One-click deploy for AI workloads.               |
| **P3 – AIOps & Runbook Automation**  | Configure SSM Automation + Incident Manager; map top 10 incident patterns → auto-remediation runbooks.           | Ops-as-automation working for platform events.   |
| **P4 – FinOps & Policy Feedback**    | Enable CUR/Cost Explorer; define budgets/thresholds; wire alerts back to VS-1 for throttling.                    | Cost-aware AI platform with chargeback/showback. |
| **P5 – DR, Resilience & Compliance** | Configure Backup/Elastic DR; schedule FIS tests; export ops/audit data to VS-7.                                  | Resilient, auditable, RFP-grade ops posture.     |

⏱ **Indicative duration:** 14–18 weeks (P1–P2 parallel; P4 depends on cost tagging from VS-1).

### ✅ One-liner for the slide

> **VS-5** gives PromProm an AWS-native, auto-upgrading **Ops/MLOps spine** so every agent, RAG app, and model is observable, deployable, cost-governed, and recoverable — without building a custom NOC platform.
